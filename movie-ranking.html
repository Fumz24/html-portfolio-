<h1> The Best Movies According to Funmi</h1>
<h2> My Top Movies of all-time! </h2>

<hr /> 

<h3> Arrival </h3>
<p> This is a science fiction that was unlike any other in terms of it's simplicity
    and the story line in itself. The plot was both realistic and different than the
    typical alien species coming to earth narratives seen in other films.

<h3> Interstellar </h3>
<p> The acting was top tier! </p>

<h3> Dune 2 </h3>
<p> The cinematography along with it's plot was phenomenal! </p>
